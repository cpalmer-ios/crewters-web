This is the documentation for the Crewters Mobile App.

Crewters is built using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) and [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) with [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

This Mobile App is a work in progress. If you see dummy text on a page, it means I'm still working on it! You can follow updates on our Instagram [@crewters](https://www.instagram.com/crewters.official/#).
